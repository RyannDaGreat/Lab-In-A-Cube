 State-Stack: Just a display (To navigate you have to use items in the scene to transition etc)
Reset Button (Refreshes the iframe)
Deltas OR Materials OR Geometries OR Textures OR Sounds OR (Other Category) (Combobox)
	--> Each points to a react component and gets fed its' props. 
	(LATER IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A GRID-VIEW OF DELTAS AND ITEMS)
	Add Delta Button (Ideally goes to a modal dialog?? Or just reads from a textbox perhaps...)
	Add Item Button (Ideally goes to a modal dialog too, giving requirements to the user) 
	DeltaID	(Combobox) (Select from all deltas)
	ItemID (Combobox) (Select from all items)
		Item GUIs (Custom per item)
		(FORGET ABOUT ATTRIBUTE GUIS FOR NOW)


can be enabled/disabled to add/remove from delta, perhaps by right clicking. When not enabled, will not display anything.
